# Simple calculator app using React

**[Launch calculator](https://cute-raindrop-fe4a65.netlify.app/)**

This is a very simple calculator app built as a part of react course by meta.

Here's how it works:

- You type the value in the input box.
- You press the operation buttons and the operation will be performed between the result displayed just above the input box and the number in the input box.

For example, if you type 100 in the input box and result shows 0, pressing add will change the result to 100. If you reset input and type 20 and press divide, it will show 5.
